    <description lang="en">"Drawing on the legacy of the groundbreaking Al Jazeera Arabic channel, Al Jazeera English was launched on November 15, 2006 to more than 80 million households worldwide.[CR][CR] The 24-hour news and current affairs channel is the first international English-language news channel to broadcast across the globe from the Middle East.[CR][CR] Al Jazeera's global footprint continues to grow and now broadcasts to more than 220 million households on six continents in more than 100 countries.[CR][CR] Our channel is broadcast from four strategic broadcast centres: Doha, Kuala Lumpur, London, and Washington DC. Unlike other international channels, we broadcast from our different centres, as the world turns, providing the most comprehensive and contextual news coverage.[CR][CR] Our mission is to provide independent, impartial news for an international audience and to offer a voice to a diversity of perspectives from under-reported regions.[CR][CR] In addition, the channel aims to balance the information flow between the South and the North.[CR][CR] The channel of reference for the Middle East and Africa, Al Jazeera has unique access to some of the worldâ€™s most troubled and controversial locations. Our determination and ability to accurately reflect the truth on the ground in regions torn by conflict and poverty has set our content apart."[CR][CR] Source: Al Jazeera
