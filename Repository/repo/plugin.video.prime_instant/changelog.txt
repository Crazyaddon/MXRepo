! Important note for US and UK users !
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't test this addon with US and UK accounts. Neither do I have a membership
for amazon.com nor for amazon.co.uk. Even if I would have one, geoblocking will
deny any access to the video content. It is very important for me to get log
files from kodi with activated debugging. If you are using prime instant video
in US or UK and get any errors or problems while using this addon, please tell
me and please do not forget your kodi.log! :)
