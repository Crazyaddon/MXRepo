[B]Version 1.2.0 - 2011-08-20[/B]
- Completely rewritten again to use RSS Podcast feeds
  as the solution in version 1.1.0 was too fragile.

- Rewritten to use individual websites instead of tv2regionerne.dk,
  because this is no longer updated
- [I]Danmark Rundt[/I] is no longer available
- [I]TV2/Bornholm[/I] is not included currently, because it
  requires streaming via rtmps://
